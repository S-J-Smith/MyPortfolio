            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p><em>I am Steve and I am 33 Years old and live and work in the UK.  I have been working in IT now for over 11 years and for the most part with a large International law firm
                Where I have gained the majority of my knowledge and experience within the Profession.  I am now finding that I have had enough working as an Application Support
                Specialist and have decided to study in my own time from my own pocket to become a Web Developer.  Since exploring my options I found that I really enjoy learning
                web development and the creative element it has to it and also like the flexible lifestyle that can go with it which better suits who I am and who I want to be.</em>
            </p>
            <p><em>This site will act as my Portfolio and with the aim of this being an eventual main point of reference for future employment and/or work in the field and therefore
                my goal here is to have a fully functional interactive, colourful and accessible website to showcase my skills and experience along my journey to become the best web
                developer I can possibly be!</em>
